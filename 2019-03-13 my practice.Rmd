## R Markdown
R studio
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
```{r}
a <- 2
3 -> b
a2<-5L
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
65+a
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
hi
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r}
`107學年度`<-100
```

```{r}
class(a)
class(a2)
```
```{r}
aVector<-c(5,6,7)
a2Vector<-c(5L,6L,7L)
```

```{r}
a2Vector
aVector
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
